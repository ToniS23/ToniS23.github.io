        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a recent graduate with both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. With a strong academic background and a growing passion for cybersecurity, particularly in penetration testing, I am dedicated to advancing my expertise in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.

        This blog is a space where I will share my professional journey, document my progress, and provide insights into my work in cybersecurity. Here, I will regularly update with projects, technical write-ups, and other relevant content as I continue to develop my skills and contribute to the field.</p>
